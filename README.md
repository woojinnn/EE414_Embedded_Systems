Implemented metronome with beaglebone using various methods(e.g., network, thread, clock, etc...)

## Platform
Beaglebone Board
Ubuntu 16.04

## Purposes
### Lab1
Get acquainted with the cross development system

### Lab2
Write a program for LED display output on the embedded board, to output beats of the metronome visually using LED lamps with fixed tempo of 60 and fixed time-signature of 6/8

### Lab3
In order to grab a firm concept on serial communication, a serial input for the metronome will be programmed.
This program will be used to send a command string from the PC to the embedded board via RS-232C serial cable(actually USB cable).

### Lab4
Understand how to program the interrupt and timer via signal handler on the AM3359 processor in Beaglebone with Linux.

### Lab5
Understand how to use Ethernet and program a typical network program using sockets, and implement a remote user command input for the metronome
